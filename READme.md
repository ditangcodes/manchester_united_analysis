GitHub Repositories for Inspiration:
There are existing GitHub repositories that analyze football teams, including Manchester United. One such repository is Rupakverse/Manchester-United-Team-Analysis-using-Python1. It covers an in-depth analysis of Manchester United’s performance under Erik ten Hag from 2022 to 2024. You can explore the code, data, and insights there.
To get started, you might want to:
Clone the Repository: If you’re familiar with Git, clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Read the Code: Go through the Python scripts in the repository. Understand how they load data, perform analysis, and create visualizations.
Adapt and Extend: You can build upon this existing work by adding your own analyses or modifying it to suit your specific goals.
Load and Explore Data:
Start by collecting data related to Manchester United. You can find historical match data, player statistics, and team performance metrics.
For example, you can load Premier League data into a Pandas DataFrame using Python. Here’s a basic snippet:
Python

import pandas as pd

# Load EPL data into a DataFrame (replace with your actual data file path)
epl_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/EPL_data.csv')
epl_df.head()
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Replace 'path/to/your/EPL_data.csv' with the actual path to your data file.
Explore the loaded data to understand its structure, available features, and any missing values.
Data Visualization:
Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations. You can plot goals scored, match results, home vs. away performance, and more.
For instance, create a bar chart showing Manchester United’s goals scored in different seasons or a line plot illustrating their points progression over time.
Formations and Tactics:
Investigate the formations used by Manchester United. You can analyze which formations led to better results.
Visualize formations (e.g., heatmaps) to understand player positioning during matches.
Player Performance:
Explore individual player statistics. Who were the top goal scorers? Which players had the most assists?
Consider creating scatter plots or radar charts to compare player performance.
Venue Analysis:
Analyze performance at different venues (home vs. away). Did Manchester United perform better at Old Trafford or away stadiums?
